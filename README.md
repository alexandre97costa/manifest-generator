# manifest-generator
A single HTML file that will help you create manifest.json files for your Minecraft Bedrock Packs. AND it even works offline!

# How to use
Either download the html file into your devce or visit LINK. Just choose a name and description and it will magically update a json file, shown below in a textarea. The you can either download the file or copy the contents to your clipboard. It's that simple.

# Some disclaimers
1. The Minimum Engine Version is not customizable. I chose 1.11.0 as default, to make the process a bit quicker. This usually doesn't affect your packs, and you can always change the number after downloading/copying the file.
2. The UUIDs in the file are made client-side, with no recursion to APIs. It uses Math.random(), which is fine for this type of stuff as it doesn't need to be secure, just fairly unique. This is to allow the website to be used offline.

# Feedback
