# manifest-generator.html
A single HTML file that will help you create manifest.json files for your Minecraft Bedrock Packs. AND it even works offline!

# How to use
Either download the html file into your device or visit https://alexandre97costa.github.io/manifest-generator/. 
Just choose a name and description and it will magically update a json file, shown below in a textarea. Then you can either download the file or copy the contents to your clipboard. It's that simple.

# Some disclaimers
1. The Minimum Engine Version is not customizable. I chose 1.11.0 as default, to make the process a bit quicker. This usually doesn't affect your packs, and you can always change the number after downloading/copying the file.
2. The UUIDs in the file are made client-side, using Math.random(). This is to allow the website to be used offline.

# Feedback
Want me to change something about the project or tell me I smell good? You can always message me on Discord (Calimero#2948) or leave a suggestion in this repository. Cheers!
